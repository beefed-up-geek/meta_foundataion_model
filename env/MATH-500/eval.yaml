            Solve the following math problem efficiently and clearly.  The last line
            of your response should be of the following format: 'Therefore, the final
            answer is: $\\boxed{ANSWER}$. I hope it is correct' (without quotes)
            where ANSWER is just the final number or expression that solves the
            problem. Think step by step before answering.
